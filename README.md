# Individual Research & Coding Projects

This repository collects my individual research and coding projects in macroeconomics, monetary policy, and international trade.

Typical projects include:
- Estimation and simulation of New Keynesian models (e.g. NKOE with Rotemberg price adjustment costs) in Dynare/MATLAB.
- Small structural or semi-structural models for monetary policy analysis.
- Trade and open-economy applications, occasionally linked to coursework or thesis work.
- Econometric and macroeconometric exercises that go beyond standard coursework.

Each project is self-contained, with code, a short description, and (where possible) replication instructions.

## Structure (planned)

```text
individual_projects/
├─ nkoe-rotemberg/
│  ├─ code/        # Dynare / MATLAB / Stata / Python scripts
│  ├─ output/      # Figures, tables, saved results
│  └─ README.md    # Project-specific description and notes
├─ <project-2>/
│  ├─ code/
│  ├─ output/
│  └─ README.md
└─ ...
```

New projects will follow roughly the same structure:
- `code/` — main scripts / notebooks
- `output/` — plots, tables, estimation results
- `README.md` — what the project does, how to run it, and references

## Reproducibility

- When possible, I rely only on open-source or freely available software and datasets.
- Proprietary or confidential data are **never** included in this repository.
- If a project relies on restricted data, I replace them with:
  - synthetic or public data; or
  - sanitized examples plus instructions on how to adapt the code.

Where relevant, each project README specifies:
- required software (e.g. Dynare version, MATLAB toolboxes, Stata/R/Python packages);
- minimal steps to reproduce key figures or IRFs.

## Relation to other repositories

- `coursework` — selected BSc and MSc assignments.
- `papers` — BSc thesis and paper sources.

This repository is more exploratory and research-oriented: it focuses on model-based projects and numerical experiments rather than graded coursework.
